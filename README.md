## About me

Hi, my name is Julio Daniel Fern√°ndez and I am a jr software engineer. Nowadays I work at a mexican company called [Nuxiba Technologies](http://www.nuxiba.com/en/index.html) which is based in Mexico City. This is one of my self teaching repositories and I hope you find one of my projects helpful for learning yourself.

## About the project

This a very simple react-redux based e-shop site project that I did as a learning task. I intended to use pure JavaScript and React libraries for the front-end part of the project and a ASP.Net WebService in conjunction with a SQL database for the back-end. 


## Technologies Involved

The react interface was built using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) in the [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) enviroment. The Responsiveness of the website was implemented using an npm package called [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) which is based on Twitter's [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
